# Web-Scraping-and-Visualization
## Preview
#### In this project, I took on the role of a Data Scientist / Data Analyst for a startup investment firm. The firm's objective was to assist clients in making informed stock investments. I leveraged ```Python``` libraries and web scraping techniques to gather financial data, including historical share prices and quarterly revenue reports, for several prominent stocks: ``Tesla``, ``Amazon``,``AMD``, and ``GameStop``. Subsequently, I visualized this data on a dashboard, facilitating the identification of noteworthy patterns and trends. This endeavor aimed to provide valuable insights for investment decision-making.
## Dashboard Analytics Displayed
#### I undertook the task of creating an insightful dashboard that offers a comprehensive overview of key performance indicators (KPIs) in a visually intuitive manner. The focus was on honing the skills of analyzing a dataset and extracting essential ``KPIs``. To facilitate the learning process of accessing and presenting data through dashboards, I employed prompts and exercises.

#### Throughout the project, I employed ``Plotly``, a powerful data visualization library, to craft visually engaging and informative charts. It's important to note that prior experience with Plotly is not obligatory to participate in this course. The central goal of this endeavor was to cultivate a solid understanding of displaying critical performance metrics on a dashboard, enhancing participants' ability to communicate insights effectively through ``data visualization``. 
#### In this project, the platforms chosen for implementation are Skills Network Labs and Watson Studio. Skills Network Labs provides a controlled environment where learners can engage in hands-on practice and complete lab exercises as part of the course curriculum. On the other hand, Watson Studio, which is a key component of IBM Cloud Pak for Data, offers a comprehensive suite of tools and a collaborative workspace. It is specifically designed to cater to a diverse range of professionals, including data scientists, data analysts, AI and machine learning engineers, and domain experts.

#### By utilizing Skills Network Labs, learners gain access to a practical and controlled sandbox environment that facilitates active learning and skill-building. Watson Studio, on the other hand, provides a powerful platform that enables seamless development and deployment of projects, fostering collaboration among various stakeholders involved in data-related tasks.

#### Through the integration of these two platforms, participants in the project are provided with a dynamic and comprehensive learning experience. This environment equips them with the necessary tools and resources to effectively analyze data, create visualizations, and ultimately enhance their proficiency in the field of data science and analytics.
